# DiscordDelver
This would be a program to monitor several discord servers and specified channels for new images and/or scrape all previous ones. A main feature goal is that you could provide images of your favorite meme as a training set for image recognition AI, then it would go through and collect similar images. The application would also serve as a collection management of sorts.
